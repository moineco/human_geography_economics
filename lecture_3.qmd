# Geocoding for survey and natural experiment

Râ€™s flexibility and evolving geographic capabilities is interactive map making. This is demonstrated by the following code chunk, which creates @fig-mymap-3.

```{r fig-mymap-3, cache = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig.cap: "The blue markers indicate some specific geographic locations. The basemap is a tiled image of the Earth at night provided by NASA."
library(leaflet)
popup = c("Robin", "Jakub", "Jannes")
leaflet() |>
  addProviderTiles("NASAGIBS.ViirsEarthAtNight2012") |>
  addMarkers(lng = c(-3, 23, 11),
             lat = c(52, 53, 49), 
             popup = popup)
```
