## Introduction to Gegraphic Information System (GIS)

### Definition of Geoinformatics

-   Geoinformatics is the science and the technology which develops and uses information science infrastructure to address the problems of geography and related branches of science and engineering.

### Why we need to study Geoinformatics?

-   Geoinformatics become very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines.
    -   Agriculture
    -   Climate change
    -   Oceanography
    -   Business location planning
    -   Architecture
    -   Telecommunications
    -   Criminology
    -   Aviation
    -   Biodiversity conservation
    -   Urban planning
    -   Land use management
    -   Navigation systems
    -   Public health
    -   Environmental analysis
    -   Military
    -   Transport network planning
    -   Maritime transport

### Geographic coordinate system (GCS)

-   A geographic coordinate system is a three-dimensional reference system that locates points on the Earth's surface. The unit of measure is usually decimal degrees. A point has two coordinate values:

    -   Latitude and
    -   Longitude

### How to find coordinates on Google Maps on the mobile app?

-   Open the Google Maps app on your iPhone or Android phone

-   Enter the location, or select and hold to drop a pin on the map of the location you want the coordinates for

-   Scroll down to find the coordinates.

-   Tap the coordinates to copy to your phone's clipboard

-   Paste the coordinates

> Find coordinates to identify and share the location of the Eikokuji Campus of Kochi University of Technology.

### Software

-   We will primarily use QGIS and R software.
-   Why?
    -   These are powerful and free
    -   Available in this lab
    -   You can install in your own machine

### For next lectures

-   Install QGIS in your computer (If you have any difficulties to install, I will guide you to install the software during our face-to-face lectures.)

-   The web-link for downloading the software is below: <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>
