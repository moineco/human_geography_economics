# Introduction to Geographic Information System (GIS)

- A geographic information system (GIS) consists of integrated computer hardware and software that store, manage, analyze, edit, output, and visualize geographic data.

## Definition of Geoinformatics

-   Geoinformatics is the science and the technology which develops and uses information science infrastructure to address the problems of geography and related branches of science and engineering.

## Why we need to study Geoinformatics?

Geoinformatics become very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines:

    -   Agriculture
    -   Climate change
    -   Oceanography
    -   Business location planning
    -   Architecture
    -   Telecommunications
    -   Criminology
    -   Aviation
    -   Biodiversity conservation
    -   Urban planning
    -   Land use management
    -   Navigation systems
    -   Public health
    -   Environmental analysis
    -   Military
    -   Transport network planning
    -   Maritime transport

## Geographic coordinate system (GCS) 

- Geographic coordinate system (GCS) is a three-dimensional reference system that locates points on the Earth's surface. The unit of measure is usually decimal degrees. A point has two coordinate values:

    -   Latitude and
    -   Longitude

### Find coordinates on google maps on the mobile app:

    -   Open the google maps app on your iPhone or Android phone
    -   Enter the location, or select and hold to drop a pin on the map of the location you want the coordinates for
    -   Scroll down to find the coordinates.
    -   Tap the coordinates to copy to your phone's clipboard
    -   Paste the coordinates

> Find coordinates to identify and share the location of the Eikokuji Campus of Kochi University of Technology.

### Software

We will primarily use QGIS and R software. Reasons:

    -   These are powerful and free
    -   Available in this lab
    -   You can install in your own machine

### For next lectures

-   Install QGIS in your computer (If you have any difficulties to install, I will guide you to install the software during our face-to-face lectures.)

-   The web-link for downloading the software is below: <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>

Everything you need is in Moodle:

    -    Syllabus
    -    Lecture materials
    -    Assigned reading
    -    Assignments
    -    Email address to submit homework, assignments and reports: **geoinformatics.moinul\@gmail.com**
