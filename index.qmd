Hundreds of thousands of organizations are using geographic information system (GIS) to make maps that communicate, perform analysis, share information, and solve complex problems around the world. This "Human Geography and Economics" course basically deals with GIS, a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Every day, GIS powers millions of decisions around the world. It makes a big impact on our lives and you might not even realize it.

The "Human Geography and Economics" course contents are as below:

Section 1: What is geographic information system (GIS)?

-   Lecture 1: Introduction to GIS

-   Lecture 2: GIS information provision

-   Lecture 3: Geocoding for survey and natural experiment

-   Lecture 4: GIS for biodiversity management

-   Lecture 5: GIS for natural resource management

Section 2: What is geographic data?

-   Lecture 6: Spatial data collection, storage and management

-   Lecture 7: Spatial data visualization

-   Lecture 8: Spatial data process

-   Lecture 9: Spatial data create

-   Lecture 10: Spatial data analyze

Section 3: How geographic data can be utilized for the policy analysis?

-   Lecture 11: Social applications of GIS

-   Lecture 12: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 1)

-   Lecture 13: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 2)

-   Lecture 14: GIS to solving real world problem ($CO_2$ emission)

-   Lecture 15: GIS to solving real world problem (Biodiversity)

This lecture is for the readers who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R and QGIS that has powerful data processing, visualization and geo-spatial capabilities. The book covers a wide range of topics and will be of interest to a wide range of people from many different backgrounds, especially:

- Graduate students and researchers from fields specializing in geographic data including geography, remote sensing, planning, GIS and geographic data science.

- Academics and post-graduate students working with geographic data â€” in fields such as economics, political science, finance, ecology etc.

- The book is designed for introductory-to-intermediate R users interested in geocomputation and who does not have prior experience with geographic data.


The book is divided into three parts:

- Part I: Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R.
- Part II: Extensions, which covers intermediate techniques.
- Part III: Applications, to real-world problems.

Geocomputation with QGIS and R will equip you with knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues, including those with scientific, societal and environmental implications, manifested in geographic data.
