    "text": "Preface\nUpdated on: 2023-03-13\nHundreds of thousands of organizations are using geographic information system (GIS) to make maps that communicate, perform analysis, share information, and solve complex problems around the world. This “Human Geography and Economics” course basically deals with GIS, a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Every day, GIS powers millions of decisions around the world. It makes a big impact on our lives and you might not even realize it.\nThe “Human Geography and Economics” course contents are as below:\nSection 1: What is geographic information system (GIS)?\n\nLecture 1: Introduction to GIS\nLecture 2: GIS information provision\nLecture 3: Geocoding for survey and natural experiment\nLecture 4: GIS for biodiversity management\nLecture 5: GIS for natural resource management\n\nSection 2: What is geographic data?\n\nLecture 6: Spatial data collection, storage and management\nLecture 7: Spatial data visualization\nLecture 8: Spatial data process\nLecture 9: Spatial data create\nLecture 10: Spatial data analyze\n\nSection 3: How geographic data can be utilized for the policy analysis?\n\nLecture 11: Social applications of GIS\nLecture 12: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 1)\nLecture 13: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 2)\nLecture 14: GIS to solving real world problem (\\(CO_2\\) emission)\nLecture 15: GIS to solving real world problem (Biodiversity)\n\n\n\n\nFig 1: Geographic Information System\n\n\nThis lecture is for the readers who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R and QGIS that has powerful data processing, visualization and geo-spatial capabilities. The book covers a wide range of topics and will be of interest to a wide range of people from many different backgrounds, especially:\n\nGraduate students and researchers from fields specializing in geographic data including geography, remote sensing, planning, GIS and geographic data science.\nAcademics and post-graduate students working with geographic data — in fields such as economics, political science, finance, ecology etc.\nThe book is designed for introductory-to-intermediate R users interested in geocomputation and who does not have prior experience with geographic data.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts:\n\nPart I: Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R.\nPart II: Extensions, which covers intermediate techniques.\nPart III: Applications, to real-world problems.\n\nGeocomputation with QGIS and R will equip you with knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues, including those with scientific, societal and environmental implications, manifested in geographic data."

These have discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector datasets usually have a high level of precision.\nThe raster data model divides the surface up into cells of constant size. Raster datasets are the basis of background images used in web-mapping and have been a vital source of geographic data since the origins of aerial photography and satellite-based remote sensing devices. Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution\n\nWhich to use? The answer likely depends on your domain of application:\n\nVector data tends to dominate the social sciences because human settlements tend to have discrete borders\nRaster dominates many environmental sciences because of the reliance on remote sensing data"

    "text": "3.1 Use the package sf\n\nlibrary(sf)\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.11.1, GDAL 3.6.2, PROJ 9.1.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\nlibrary(spData)       \nlibrary(spDataLarge)   \n\nWe will use the world dataset provided by spData, loaded at the beginning of this chapter, to show what sf objects are and how they work. world is an ‘sf data frame’ containing spatial and attribute columns, the names of which are returned by the function names() (the last column in this example contains the geographic information):\n\nclass(world)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\nnames(world)\n\n [1] \"iso_a2\"    \"name_long\" \"continent\" \"region_un\" \"subregion\" \"type\"     \n [7] \"area_km2\"  \"pop\"       \"lifeExp\"   \"gdpPercap\" \"geom\"     \n\n\nWe will plot this world class by using plot() in Figure 3.2\n\n\nCode\nplot(world)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: A spatial plot of the world using the sf package, with a facet for each attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Summarize the data\nBeing able to treat spatial objects as regular data frames with spatial powers has many advantages, especially if you are already used to working with data frames. The commonly used summary() function, for example, provides a useful overview of the variables within the world object.\n\nsummary(world[\"lifeExp\"])\n\n    lifeExp                 geom    \n Min.   :50.62   MULTIPOLYGON :177  \n 1st Qu.:64.96   epsg:4326    :  0  \n Median :72.87   +proj=long...:  0  \n Mean   :70.85                      \n 3rd Qu.:76.78                      \n Max.   :83.59                      \n NA's   :10                         \n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Sub-plots in sf package\nOne sub-plot for each variable of the object, as illustrated in the left-hand panel in Figure 3.3\n\n\nCode\nplot(world[3:6])\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Plotting with sf with multiple variables\n\n\n\n\nA sub-plot for the population in our world in Figure 3.4\n\n\nCode\nplot(world[\"pop\"])\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Population around the world\n\n\n\n\nPlots are added as layers to existing images by setting add = TRUE. The subsequent code chunk filters countries in Asia and combines them into a single feature:\n\nworld_asia = world[world$continent == \"Asia\", ]\nasia = st_union(world_asia)\n\nWe can now plot the Asian continent over a map of the world in Figure 3.5\n\n\nCode\nplot(world[\"pop\"], reset = FALSE)\nplot(asia, add = TRUE, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: A plot of Asia added as a layer on top of countries worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Base plot arguments\nThere are various ways to modify maps with sf’s plot() method. Figure 3.6 illustrates this flexibility by overlaying circles, whose diameters (set with cex =) represent country populations, on a map of the world.\n\n\nCode\nplot(world[\"continent\"], reset = FALSE)\ncex = sqrt(world$pop) / 10000\nworld_cents = st_centroid(world, of_largest = TRUE)\nplot(st_geometry(world_cents), add = TRUE, cex = cex)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Country continents (represented by fill color) and 2015 populations.\n\n\n\n\nsf’s plot method also has arguments specific to geographic data. expandBB, for example, can be used to plot an sf object in context: it takes a numeric vector of length four that expands the bounding box of the plot relative to zero in the following order: bottom, left, top, right. Figure 3.7 plot India in the context of its giant Asian neighbors\n\n\nCode\nindia = world[world$name_long == \"India\", ]\nplot(st_geometry(india), expandBB = c(0, 0.2, 0.1, 1), col = \"gray\", lwd = 3)\nplot(world_asia[0], add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: India in context, demonstrating the expandBB argument."
