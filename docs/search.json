    "text": "Preface\nUpdated on: 2023-03-13\nHundreds of thousands of organizations are using geographic information system (GIS) to make maps that communicate, perform analysis, share information, and solve complex problems around the world. This “Human Geography and Economics” course basically deals with GIS, a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Every day, GIS powers millions of decisions around the world. It makes a big impact on our lives and you might not even realize it.\nThe “Human Geography and Economics” course contents are as below:\nSection 1: What is geographic information system (GIS)?\n\nLecture 1: Introduction to GIS\nLecture 2: GIS information provision\nLecture 3: Geocoding for survey and natural experiment\nLecture 4: GIS for biodiversity management\nLecture 5: GIS for natural resource management\n\nSection 2: What is geographic data?\n\nLecture 6: Spatial data collection, storage and management\nLecture 7: Spatial data visualization\nLecture 8: Spatial data process\nLecture 9: Spatial data create\nLecture 10: Spatial data analyze\n\nSection 3: How geographic data can be utilized for the policy analysis?\n\nLecture 11: Social applications of GIS\nLecture 12: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 1)\nLecture 13: GIS to solving real world problem (Nankai trough hazard map 2)\nLecture 14: GIS to solving real world problem (\\(CO_2\\) emission)\nLecture 15: GIS to solving real world problem (Biodiversity)\n\n\n\n\nFig 1: Geographic Information System\n\n\nThis lecture is for the readers who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R and QGIS that has powerful data processing, visualization and geo-spatial capabilities. The book covers a wide range of topics and will be of interest to a wide range of people from many different backgrounds, especially:\n\nGraduate students and researchers from fields specializing in geographic data including geography, remote sensing, planning, GIS and geographic data science.\nAcademics and post-graduate students working with geographic data — in fields such as economics, political science, finance, ecology etc.\nThe book is designed for introductory-to-intermediate R users interested in geocomputation and who does not have prior experience with geographic data.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts:\n\nPart I: Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R.\nPart II: Extensions, which covers intermediate techniques.\nPart III: Applications, to real-world problems.\n\nGeocomputation with R and QGIS will equip you with knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues, including those with scientific, societal and environmental implications, manifested in geographic data."

As can be seen from Figure 2.1, lines of equal latitude and longitude do not form straight lines, indicating that some form of projection took place before plotting.\nThe color values in Figure 2.1 are derived from numeric values of a variable, BIR74, which has a single value associated with each geometry or feature. In this case, BIR74 refers to birth counts, meaning counts over the region. This implies that the count does not refer to a value associated with every point inside the polygon, which the continuous color might suggest, but rather measures an integral (sum) over the polygon."
